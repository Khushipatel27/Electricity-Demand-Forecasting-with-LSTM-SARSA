# ‚ö° Electricity Demand Forecasting with LSTM & SARSA

This project explores hybrid approaches for forecasting electricity demand using:
- Deep Learning (LSTM) to capture sequential patterns in time-series data  
- Reinforcement Learning (SARSA) to optimize decision-making policies based on forecasts  

---

## üìå Overview / Motivation
Accurate electricity demand forecasting is crucial for:
- Ensuring grid stability  
- Reducing costs from over/under-supply  
- Enabling better renewable energy integration  

While LSTM provides reliable short-term forecasts, SARSA introduces an adaptive reinforcement learning agent that learns how to optimize energy management strategies from demand predictions. Together, they provide both prediction and decision optimization.

## Future Work
  - Hyperparameter tuning (LSTM layers, SARSA learning rate, epsilon decay)
  - Compare with other RL algorithms (Q-learning, DQN)
  - Include seasonal and holiday effects
  - Deploy as a Flask/Django API or interactive dashboard
